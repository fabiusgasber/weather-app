# Weather App

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Advanced JavaScript Curriculum**. It is a web application designed to display detailed weather information for the current day. Users can view data such as temperature, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, and several other weather indicators.

## Key Features

- **Detailed Weather Information**: Provides a comprehensive overview of todayâ€™s weather, including temperature, wind speed, and more.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can select their preferred measurement units for data presentation.  
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches accurate and up-to-date weather data from a public API.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code while deepening my understanding of:

### **Asynchronous Programming**
- Mastered working with **Promises** and the `async/await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
- Implemented seamless data fetching using a weather API.

### **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Ensured each class or function has a well-defined and focused purpose.
- **Open/Closed**: Designed components to be extendable without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Followed modular design practices for flexible component interchangeability.
- **Interface Segregation**: Avoided unnecessary dependencies or tightly coupled components.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Abstracted dependencies to allow for easier testing and code evolution.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I gained deeper insights into:
- Designing applications with **ES6 modules** for better organization and scalability.
- Writing asynchronous JavaScript with a focus on **data fetching** and API integration.
- Maintaining **clean code architecture** by adhering to best practices and design principles.
